As tragic as this is, someone has brought to my attention that with LR gone, something needs to take it's place. BLC has been around for more than a month (it's crazy that it has actually been that long already), and sadly not much has been happening. A few users on the forum it had originated, http://hackforums.net, have used this digital currency to sell, and buy items, me included, but it hasn't yet picked up and been picked up by the rest of the internet. Maybe this is our chance though, maybe with LR gone BLC can fill the void, maybe, just maybe, BLC will actually be something more than just a project I created in my spare time. Maybe. It is too early to tell yet, so for now all we can do is wait. There are those who love BLC and those who hate it. Unfortunately those who hate it greatly out weight those who love it, but again, only time will tell what the fate of BLC is, all that I can do right now is sit back and wait.</span></p><p><span class='title'><h1>First Post</h1></span><span class='data'><h4>5 / 26 / 2013</h4></span><span class='post'>This is a blog I made to try out GitHub pages and also to have a personal archive, and an area I can express myself on opinions I have, mainly in the programming world. If you would like to see the source for this site, head over to <a href="http://github.com/Max00355/Project-Frankie">here</a>. I'll be updating this when I feel like it so be sure to check every once in a while! And no, I don't plan on getting a real domain :P</span></p>
