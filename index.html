Today I present to you ByteMail a P2P messaging protocol for sending email-like messages with no central authority. The current release is a very barebones release, only demonstrating basic functionality right now. I plan to extend it and maybe add a GUI in the future once everything else is sorted out. If you would like to get a hold of the project you can check it out <a href="http://github.com/Max00355/ByteMessage">here</a>.

I find that creating a guessing game helps me get a real feel for what the language is like, and helps me decide whether it would worth continuing to learn the language. A guessing game helps me get a taste of every part of the language, if statements, loops, variables, random numbers, etc. These concepts are some of the most important to grasp in any language, and a guessing game has it all! Well, I just thought I would share my method with you all! Enjoy!

Haha, when I post it is just one big thought I am trying to turn into words and it ends up becoming a long post about nothing really important. I just wanted thought I would post this because here I am rambling again! I am going to stop and head to bed.

</span></p><p><span class='title'><h1>ByteChat, a Peer-to-Peer IM Network</h1></span><span class='data'><h4>5 / 30 / 2013 22:6:11</h4></span><span class='post'>Recently I have been dabbling with some P2P systems and trying to learn as much as I can about that type of programming. I have to say, It has been a hell of a lot of fun, and a real challenge. I still don't understand a lot of the concepts, especially those that allow a server to get around a firewall. With that being said, I would like to discuss my latest project ByteChat, a Peer-to-peer IM system I had built. I did not create ByteChat to be a secretive, I created it with the goal of having a simple system, that would be easy to write clients for, and that is ALWAYS UP. Unlike a central server system, a P2P system virtually never goes down, easily anyway. I have more or less accomplished this task, however there is one concept that contradicts this goal, but it is needed in order to make the system work. Node need to be able to find eachother, and the only logical way to do this is by use of a central server that matches up nodes. These nodes are matched up, no request is ever made to this central server again, so if it goes down communication is still possible! The chat style itself is simular to an online chatroom. There are rooms, and you can assign yourself a nickname and what not. As of right now, only a commandline PoC exists but I am working hard on a GUI client that I hope to release soon. It has been a fun project in which I learned a lot from, and I hope all of you will be able to learn as well! One more thing, ByteChat does need to bind to an open port, so you may been to port forward in order to get the client to run... Anyway, once you have that working come chat with me! I will be idling in the PF room. <p>You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/Max00355/ByteChat">here</a></p>

Is it even possible to become addicted to programming? After some search online on the topic, it turns out it is very possible... and I may be an addict. Some people are addicted to TV, others addicted to videogames, for me programming is my drug. I can never seem to get away from it! Sometimes I will be up until three in the morning trying to figure out a bug that really isn't that important. It won't change my life if I fix it either way, but it is just the satisfaction of getting something to work the way it was intended that fules me. I am sure that there are worse things one could be addicted to, but I just thought I would share this. How about you? Are you an addict? 
</span></p><p><span class='title'><h1>So I got a domain...</h1></span><span class='data'><h4>5 / 27 / 2013 9:46:34</h4></span><span class='post'>In my first post I had said that I wasn't going to get a domain, but that was until I discovered an awesome website that was selling domain names for $0.50! I got my domain, projectfrankie.org, from <a href='https://www.networksolutions.com/'>https://www.networksolutions.com/</a> for just $0.50! How can anyone beat that deal? I could not pass up that oppertunity! So I lied to you all when I said that I wasn't going to buy a domain, because I did. It's better this way anyway.
</span></p><p><span class='title'><h1>The Obsession With Creating Everything Myself</h1></span><span class='data'><h4>5 / 27 / 2013 0:47:26</h4></span><span class='post'>Every since I started programming I have had a strange obsession with creating everything myself, even if it wasn't correct, or worse than the already existing implementations. If you have followed my projects at all, you will notice that a lot of them are variations of things that already exist. For example, one of my recent projects PyMail attempts to act as an email system. Of course, it fails misseribly, but I don't care! I did it myself, there for it is awesome! SMTP you say? Screw that! It's alreay been done, that's boring. I am going to create my own shit that no one will use! Why? BECAUSE I CAN! So yeah, went off on a tangent there, so I will stop, but now you understand why I do what I do, and hopefully will not question me as much.</span></p><p><span class='title'><h1>Liberty Reserve Gone, The Rise of BlooCoin</h1></span><span class='data'><h4>5 / 27 / 2013</h4></span><span class='post'>As we all know by now, the owner of Liberty Reserve was arrested and imprisoned for 5 years, resulting in the shut down of one of the most beloved ways to get paid. As tragic as this is, someone has brought to my attention that with LR gone, something needs to take it's place. BLC has been around for more than a month (it's crazy that it has actually been that long already), and sadly not much has been happening. A few users on the forum it had originated, http://hackforums.net, have used this digital currency to sell, and buy items, me included, but it hasn't yet picked up and been picked up by the rest of the internet. Maybe this is our chance though, maybe with LR gone BLC can fill the void, maybe, just maybe, BLC will actually be something more than just a project I created in my spare time. Maybe. It is too early to tell yet, so for now all we can do is wait. There are those who love BLC and those who hate it. Unfortunately those who hate it greatly out weight those who love it, but again, only time will tell what the fate of BLC is, all that I can do right now is sit back and wait.</span></p><p><span class='title'><h1>First Post</h1></span><span class='data'><h4>5 / 26 / 2013</h4></span><span class='post'>This is a blog I made to try out GitHub pages and also to have a personal archive, and an area I can express myself on opinions I have, mainly in the programming world.
